conclusion :In summary, our project using polynomial regression for stock price prediction showed promising results. The model effectively captured historical trends, providing valuable insights for forecasting. However, caution is needed to prevent overfitting, especially with higher polynomial degrees. Future research could explore additional techniques to enhance accuracy and robustness. Overall, polynomial regression presents a useful approach for predicting stock prices, offering potential benefits for investors and analysts alike.



SOCIAL IMPACT :Our project on stock price prediction with polynomial regression has notable social implications. It empowers individual investors with valuable insights, potentially improving financial outcomes and increasing security. By democratizing access to sophisticated financial analysis, we contribute to greater inclusivity in the stock market. Additionally, our project may enhance market efficiency by improving stock price forecasts, leading to more efficient allocation of capital and a more stable economy.


tools and technologies use in the project :Our project utilized a powerful combination of tools and technologies, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Google Collab. Pandas facilitated efficient data manipulation and analysis, while NumPy provided essential numerical computing capabilities. Scikit-learn enabled us to implement machine learning algorithms, such as polynomial regression, for stock price prediction. Google Collab served as our collaborative platform, offering a cloud-based environment for coding, experimentation, and sharing results seamlessly. This integrated toolset empowered us to effectively process data, develop predictive models, and collaborate on the project in a convenient and accessible manner.
